#### Routes available in the Application

##### Create Tip Calculation:

* [X] ``http://127.0.0.1:3000/calculator``

##### List Tip Calculations:

* [X] ``http://127.0.0.1:3000/``
* [X] ``http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard``

##### Show Tip Calculation:

* [X] ``http://127.0.0.1:3000/calculations/:id``

##### Update Tip Calculation:

* [X] ``http://127.0.0.1:3000/calculations/:id``

##### Delete Tip Calculation:

* [X] ``http://127.0.0.1:3000/calculations/:id``

##### Admin Dashboard:

- [ ] Admins can access the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard` to view and manage records.

## Implementation Summary

* The development branch utilized the scaffold format for implementation. Various commands were executed on the main branch to generate models and controllers. This process provided invaluable insight into creating custom routes, models and controllers, particularly for update and delete resources.

## Approach to Solving the Challenge

### Objective

The goal was to create a user-friendly Tip Calculator application with robust functionality for both users and administrators.

### Steps Taken

1. **Database Design**:

   - [X] Created models for `TipCalculation` with fields like `bill_amount`, `tip_percentage`, `num_people`, etc., to store all calculation details.
   - [X] Ensured data integrity with validations and constraints.
2. **Routing**:

   - [X] Defined routes for calculator operations (`new`, `create`, `show, edit, destroy`).
   - [X] Added `resources` for CRUD operations on tip calculation records.
3. **Frontend**:

   - [X] Used Bootstrap for a better user experience.
   - [X] Ensured form inputs are easy to use.
4. **Backend**:

   - [X] Handled tip calculation logic in the `TipCalculatorController`.
   - [X] Provided a landing interface via the `ApplicationController`.
   - [ ] Provided an admin interface via the `AdminController` to manage records.
5. **Error Handling**:

   - [X] Added validations to ensure all required fields are filled and have valid data.
   - [ ] Displayed meaningful error messages to guide the user.
6. **Testing**:

   - [ ] Wrote model and controller tests to ensure core functionalities work as expected.

### Challenges

- [X] Ensuring the delete and edit functionality was accessible and functioning as required.
- [X] Managing data consistency for tip calculation records.
- [ ] Configure user authorisation and authentication using Devise.

### Future Enhancements

- [X] Add authentication and authorization for admin and regular users.
- [X] Enhance the UI with more interactivity using JavaScript.
- [X] Implement an API for external integrations.
